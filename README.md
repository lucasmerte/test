## Introduction

[_Ilex paraguariensis_](https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:315555-2) is an evergreen shrub or tree native to the subtropical forests of Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina that can grow up to forty-nine feet tall. It’s a plant species of the genus ilex (or “holly”) that contains caffeine as well as other alkaloid components, and it has stimulant, diuretic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties that made it attractive to both the <span eid="Q46429">indigenous Guaraní people </span> and to Spanish colonial settlers. After being dried, roasted, and powdered, mate leaves are used to prepare a hot or cold beverage, also known as mate or Paraguayan Tea. The loose powder is typically steeped in hot water in a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="210,315,148,134">drinking vessel</span> and strained through a metallic straw, or bombilla, shared by many people, passing from mouth to mouth. During the 19th century, the drink became associated with South American _gauchos_, who usually had <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="7,383,230,217">cattle</span>. Even today in South American countries, the same mate and bombilla are shared in social gatherings, a habit that has endured despite recent public health campaigns to prevent <span eid="Q84263196">COVID-19 pandemic</span>. Drinking mate remains, above all, a bonding ritual.
