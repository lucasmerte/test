## Introduction

[_Ilex paraguariensis_](https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:315555-2) is an evergreen shrub or tree native to the subtropical forests of Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina that can grow up to forty-nine feet tall. It’s a plant species of the genus ilex (or “holly”) that contains caffeine as well as other alkaloid components, and it has stimulant, diuretic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties that made it attractive to both the <span eid="Q46429">indigenous Guaraní people</span> and to Spanish colonial settlers. After being dried, roasted, and powdered, mate leaves are used to prepare a hot or cold beverage, also known as mate or Paraguayan Tea. The loose powder is typically steeped in hot water in a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="210,315,148,134">drinking vessel</span> and strained through a metallic straw, or bombilla, shared by many people, passing from mouth to mouth. During the 19th century, the drink became associated with South American _gauchos_, who usually had <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="7,383,230,217">cattle</span>. Even today in South American countries, the same mate and bombilla are shared in social gatherings, a habit that has endured despite recent public health campaigns to prevent <span eid="Q84263196">COVID-19 pandemic</span>. Drinking mate remains, above all, a bonding ritual.

## More than caffeine

The history of Jesuits in South America is deeply entangled with the history of mate, as historian Julia J. S. Sarreal has shown. Since the sixteenth century, Spanish settlers had noticed that the Guaraní people drank mate as an infusion for its energizing and healing properties, and quickly took up the habit themselves. But mate had a wider significance, since it played an essential role in Guaraní religious practices and narratives of the origins and the end of the world. Héctor A. Keller reports that according to one of these origin narratives, the Guaraní’s first ancestor turned her daughter into a large mate tree whose branches would yield the seeds of all the other native plants in the region, initiating a cyclical process of birth and regeneration that would live through all possible catastrophes and cataclysms.

## Distribution

_Mate_ is native to Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Brazil. Since the 16th century, it was associated with Paraguay, which dominated world trade. <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="-25.311734, -57.547280, 14">Asunción</span>, in Paraguay, was for a long time considered the world capital of mate

## History 

The plant was first given its Western scientific name by French botanist <span eid="Q707961">Auguste de Saint-Hilaire</span>, who traveled throughout South America between 1816 and 1822. Saint Hilaire first identified Ilex paraguariensis, which he deemed an “interesting” tree, among the ruins of the former Jesuit missions in Paraguay and Brazil.  Like many other European botanists of his time, Saint Hilaire was not only concerned with the classification of plants but also with their medicinal and commercial value, and mate was already one of the most traded commodities in the region. In fact, on the title page of his _Plantes usuelles des Brasiliens_ (1824), Saint Hilaire reproduced a quotation by Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle claiming that “the habitants of the Americas will become more and more independent of the Old World by using similar plants for the same purposes as we do.” Paradoxically, the history of mate is a case study of how American plants were turned into commodities to strengthen European rule over Indigenous peoples rather than to foster their autonomy and independence.

Yerba mate had a very long history before European settlers arrived in South America.
